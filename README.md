# Life-Risk-Portfolio-Insurance

This project leverages machine learning to address challenges in life-risk insurance, focusing on claims prediction, fraud detection, and risk segmentation. Using a comprehensive dataset combining policyholder demographics, historical claims, and U.S. Census data, predictive models were developed to optimize decision-making and operational efficiency.

The workflow included merging datasets, extensive cleaning, and applying PCA for dimensionality reduction. Supervised models like Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, SVMs, Decision Trees, and Ensemble methods (Random Forests, AdaBoost) were implemented. Logistic Regression achieved 88.33% accuracy, while Random Forests delivered near-perfect performance at 99.99%, highlighting the power of ensemble learning. SVMs, with an RBF kernel, achieved 94.24% accuracy, showcasing the importance of hyperparameter tuning.

Association Rule Mining (ARM) uncovered relationships among features like age and smoker status, offering actionable insights for insurers. Visualizations, including PCA plots, confusion matrices, and network graphs, effectively communicated findings to diverse audiences.

This project demonstrates the transformative role of machine learning in life-risk insurance, enabling fairer pricing, enhanced transparency, and data-driven decisions. It showcases how advanced analytics can drive equity and efficiency in the industry.
